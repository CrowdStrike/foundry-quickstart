# Get Started with Falcon Foundry

Are you a technology professional who's experienced problems integrating security-related data streams from your systems? If you're using distributed systems and trying to analyze them during an incident, it can be painful. Alert fatigue is real. What if you could enhance the details of your threat detections to include data and response actions from third parties or your own custom apps? You can do that now on our platform.

CrowdStrike is on the front lines of the fight against cybercriminals. We call them _adversaries_. You can learn about the names we've given them and where they live via our [Adversary Universe](https://www.crowdstrike.com/adversaries/). We even have an [Adversary Universe podcast](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/adversary-universe-podcast/).

Our Falcon platform has analytic and response features to defend and hunt against adversaries. One of those features is called Foundry. Falcon Foundry gives you the ability to build apps, extensions, and API integrations to take advantage of all the data for your organization by CrowdStrike. Through our Next-Gen <abbr title="Security Information and Event Management">SIEM</abbr>, you can even add additional data from third party sources. 

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to build your first Foundry app. It will be relatively simple, but you'll learn quite a few concepts, from using the Foundry CLI, to running in development mode, to installing the app for your users.

[table of contents - if possible]

**Prerequisites:**

- A Falcon subscription
- The Foundry CLI
- An internet connection

You can install the Foundry CLI with Homebrew on Linux/macOS.

```shell
brew tap crowdstrike/foundry-cli
brew install foundry
```

If you're on Windows, download the [latest Windows zip file](https://assets.foundry.crowdstrike.com/cli/latest/foundry_Windows_x86_64.zip), expand it, and add the installation directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

Run the following command to prove you have it installed correctly:

```shell
foundry version
```

## What is Falcon Foundry?

[Falcon Foundry](https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/next-gen-siem/falcon-foundry/) is "Cybersecurity's first low-code application platform." This is marketing-speak saying that you don't have to write a whole lot of code to build apps. We're working on adding no-code support to Foundry too, which means you'll eventually be able to build everything in a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> environment. 

> Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Matt Raible, and I'm a pro-code fan. By this, I mean I _like_ to write code and have full control over my app's functionality. I'm sceptical of low-code and no-code solutions. I'm new here at CrowdStrike, and I'm helping make our solutions easy to use, so my opinion might change as time goes on. 

There are a few modes you'll see why doing this tutorial:

- Development: Run an app on your local machine. View it in your browser or from the Falcon UI.
- Preview: Allows you to view a deployed app in the Falcon UI before releasing it.
- Release: Publish a deployed app into the App catalog.
- Install: Install a released app via the App manager. 

You'll also need a CID, or Customer ID, to work with. If you'd rather not develop in your production instance, you can create a developer CID. See the Foundry documentation for more information about this. 

## Create a Hello World App

To begin, log in to Foundry:

```shell
foundry login
```

You don't need to select any permissions for this tutorial. Click **Authorize Foundry CLI** to continue. 

This process sets up a new CLI profile and generates an API client ID and secret pair. If you want to set up another profile for an additional CID, change to that one first, then run the command again. You can use `foundry profile activate` to switch between profiles.

Navigate to a place where you like to keep code on your system. Then, create a new Foundry app:

```shell
foundry apps create
```

Provide the following values when prompted:

- Use app templates? `No`
- Name: `foundry-quickstart`
- Description: `My first Foundry app`
- Logo: `<skip>`

The result should look similar to the following:

![foundry apps create](images/foundry-apps-create.png)

Your new app directory contains only a single file, `manifest.yml`. This file is your app's deployment descriptor. As you add capabilities to your app, subdirectories will be created, and this file will be updated. 

> **Q: Should we mention the app ID and how it'll be overwritten when you do a new deployment? For example, if you clone an app from GitHub and deploy it, it should work even if the IDs are in the manifest.**

### Add a UI Extension

A UI extension is an app that will be rendered only in certain areas of Falcon. Create one with the commands below:

```shell
cd foundry-quickstart
foundry ui extensions create
```

Provide the values below: 

- Which template? `Vanilla JS`
- Name: `My First Extension`
- Description: `UI extension for Endpoint Detections page`
- Sockets: `Endpoint detection details`

The screenshot below shows how this might look in your terminal:

![foundry ui extensions create](images/foundry-ui-extensions-create.png)

You might be asking, what is a Socket? Sockets are predefined locations within the Falcon console where your extension can be rendered. Selecting **Endpoint detection details** means that your app will be rendered on the `/activity-v2/detections` page in the Falcon console, as well as `/unified-detections` in Next-Gen SIEM. When a Falcon console user selects an endpoint's detection to see its details, your app will be displayed in this panel.

You can use the `tree` command to see the directory structure and files in the project. 

```shell
$ tree .
.
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.yml
â””â”€â”€ ui
    â””â”€â”€ extensions
        â””â”€â”€ My First Extension
            â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
            â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
            â””â”€â”€ src
                â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
                â””â”€â”€ index.html
```

### Run the App Locally

Log in to Falcon and enable *Development mode*. You can do this by selecting the `</>` icon in the navbar and toggling it on. 

Run your app locally using the following command in the `foundry-quickstart` directory:

```shell
foundry ui run
```

This will start a local webserver on port 25678. Navigate to **Next-Gen SIEM** > **Detections**.

> **Q: The official quickstart guide says to go to Endpoint security > Monitor > Endpoint detections. It also says the URL will be `/activity-v2/detections/`. When I first did the tutorial, I thought it was strange to point out the URL. Later, I ran into CID issues. One CID did not have any detections on Dodo Red, so that was a blocker. Then, I tried the CrowdStrike Employees CID and was redirected from this URL to somewhere else, which indicated I did not have this feature. We should warn users about this possibility. If I go to https://falcon.dodo.crowdstrike.red/activity-v2/detections now, I get "Something went wrong" for the CS Employees CID.**

> If you're redirected back to the dashboard, it means you don't have the feature.

Select any of the detections to open the details panel. Scroll down, and you will see your extension listed near the bottom. Expand it, and you should see "Hello world loaded!"

![My First Extension screenshot](images/first-extension-screenshot.png)

The Foundry platform is in development mode, which means it has an open connection to your local machine. This means you can edit `ui/extensions/My First Extension/src/app.js` in your favorite editor, and you can see the changes right away. For example, I changed mine to say "Hello, Falcon Foundry!", then right-clicked on my app in Chrome and selected **Reload Frame**. My changes were viewable right away. Pretty slick, eh?

![Hello, Falcon Foundry](images/hello-falcon-foundry.png)

It's nice to be able to develop this way locally. Now let's deploy it to Foundry so others can see it. Stop the `foundry ui run` command with `Ctrl+C`. 

## Deploy the App to Foundry

Deploy the app to Foundry using the following command:

```shell
foundry apps deploy
```

This will prompt you for the change type and changelog:

![foundry apps deploy](images/foundry-apps-deploy.png)

Select **Major** and type in anything you'd like (e.g., "Initial deployment with UI extension") in the change log. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you get an error that the name already exists, change the name to something unique in `manifest.yml`.

### Preview the App

After deploying the app, you can preview it before you release or install it for everyone to see. Go to **Developer tools** in the navbar (the `</>` icon). Toggle development mode **off** and turn preview mode **on**. 

Now if you navigate back to the detections page (**Next-Gen SIEM** > **Detections** OR **Endpoint security** > **Endpoint detections**), you'll be able to see your extension without running anything locally.

Preview mode is a nice feature that enables you to test apps with UI features (dashboards, extensions, pages, and navigation) before releasing them. 

Go to **Developer tools** and turn off Preview mode.

## Release the App on Foundry

Release the app using the Foundry CLI:

```shell
foundry apps release
```

Choose **Major** for the change type, select the version you deployed, and fill in the release notes (e.g., "Initial release of an app with a UI extension").

> [!TIP]
> You can also do a release in the Foundry UI by going to **Foundry** > **App manager** and using **Release app** from the Actions menu. 

This process will make the app available for users in your CID. However, it will not install it. 

> **Q: Should we mention that folks need a Falcon Insight XDR or Falcon Prevent subscription to do this tutorial?**

## Install the App for Users

Go to **Foundry** > **App catalog**. Find your app, select the action menu in the bottom right corner, and **Install**. You will be prompted with a dialog explaining permissions required (this app has none) and a disclaimer. Select **Save and install**. 

After the success messages disappear, view your app by going to **Endpoint security** > **Monitor** > **Endpoint detections** again. 

In case you're wondering how versions work, minor and patch releases are updated and installed automatically. Released marked major must be accepted manually in the App catalog. 

## My Experience with Foundry

I've only been at CrowdStrike a couple of months, so I have a newbie perspective. The most difficult part for me was finding a CID with detections, and one that had the features required for this quickstart. After that, it was smooth sailing.

I learned you can create pages with `foundry ui pages create` and add them to the main menu (under **Custom Apps**). The [screencast below](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVSi0KeDbaM) shows how this works.

You can discover more about the Foundry CLI by passing `--help` after the command. For example, `foundry apps --help` or `foundry ui --help`. 

I was also successful in deploying a React app as an extension. Heck, I even got an Angular app working!

<blockquote>Later, I tried adding navigation and sub-pages to my Angular app. When Foundry modifies the HTML, it seems to cause the Angular app to use push-based routing instead of the configured hash-based routing. I'm not sure why this is, but deleting the <code>&lt;base></code> tag from the HTML (via Chrome Developer Tools) makes it work again.</blockquote>

## Learn More about Falcon Foundry

Foundry has many more features I didn't show today. 

- **API Integrations:** Connect your HTTP-based web services or those from a third party to use within Falcon. Import an OpenAPI specification or create the integration from scratch based on URLs and supported authentication types. You can even build a FaaS function (in Go or Python) to manipulate the data from the API. 
- **UI Capabilities:** Create extensions for display in detail panels, including CrowdScore incidents, endpoint detections, host management hosts, <abbr title="Extended Detection and REsponse">XDR</abbr> detections, and workflow executions. You can also create standalone pages that are added to Falcon's navigation menu.
- **Dashboard Builder:** Build a dashboard of widgets based on custom queries.
- **Workflows and Real Time Response (RTR) Scripts:** Build workflow templates to use in your apps and add RTR custom scripts. 

There's a lot to explore and absorb! If you're new to Foundry, I'm on this journey with you, so please let me know if you have questions or issues. I'd be happy to help!
